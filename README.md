# Simple Operating System 
A simple operating system which displays "What's up?" instead of "Hello World!" when it boots up.

I was planning to upload a bare bones os made from scratch to github during the weekend and this seemed to be a very straightforward process. If I have more time, I'll implement a shell in this os with some simple commands.

I used OS Dev Wiki's tutorial on https://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page as a guide to speed things up.

The extensions, .s and .asm denote assembly language.
